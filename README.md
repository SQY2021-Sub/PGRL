## Introduction 

Power converters are extensively utilized in many applications such as consumer electronics, industrial electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems, and distributed generation systems to generate either a regulated dc or ac voltage source and manage the power flow by mainly controlling the switching actions of power semiconductor devices. 'In all of these applications, the ability to accurately describe the behavior of the converter is of critical importance, as it assists in component selection, controller design, and the preliminary evaluation of the entire DC system'.
