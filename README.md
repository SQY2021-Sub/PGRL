## Introduction 

Power converters are extensively utilized in many applications such as consumer electronics, industrial electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems, and distributed generation systems to generate either a regulated dc or ac voltage source and manage the power flow by mainly controlling the switching actions of power semiconductor devices [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9351620). `In all of these applications, the ability to accurately describe the behavior of the converter is of critical importance, as it assists in component selection, controller design, and the preliminary evaluation of the entire DC system`.  Power converters exhibit an inherent nonlinear behavior due to the switching action of the power switches, thus making its modeling difficult due to the complexity of the required models.

Generally, physical modeling relies on a knowledge of the values of the dcâ€“dc converter parameters, both the passive elements and the control circuit. In addition, an accurate model should be able to reproduce ripples in currents and voltages, transients caused by switching on and off operations, etc., which is difficult to generate with physical-based modeling methods [[3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492829). Over the past few years, classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been used for the data-driven modeling of power converters with simple topologies. It is worth noting that this modeling approach falls under the task of time series forecasting, so models that are related to time series and their theoretical analysis are also applicable in this situation. However, conventional time-series data-driven approaches for power converter modeling are data-intensive, uninterpretable, and lack out-of-domain extrapolation capability. Recent physics-informed modeling methods combine physics into data-driven models using loss functions, but they inherently suffer from physical inconsistency, lower modeling accuracy, and require resource-intensive retraining for new case predictions. 

In this paper, we propose a **`physics-guided hierarchical network with the deep residual network (ResNet) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for the data-driven modeling of power converters`**, which can bridge the connection between knowledge-based model and data-driven model for enhancing converter modeling and industrial process modeling. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follow.**
